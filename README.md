### What I learned

This is my second take on this challenge after completing it 5 months ago, this time I was able to make it a lot faster and better! Not only did I fix issues with alignment but I also worked on making it a bit more accessible by adding missing landmark elements and adding a hidden `h1` on the page.

### Useful resources

- [Revisting aria-label versus a visually hidden class ](https://gomakethings.com/revisting-aria-label-versus-a-visually-hidden-class/) - This article helped clear some things to me when it comes to `aria-label` vs. "visually hidden" labels.
